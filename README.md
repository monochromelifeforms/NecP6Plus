# NEC PinWriter P6+

We had this printer growing up. In recent years, I have developed an interest for retro computing.
I found two of these printers cheap on the local equivalent of Craig's List (Kleinanzeigen).

Only one came with a paper support, and it had one of the retention arms broken off. I modelled this and 3D-printed a replacement.
The 3MF model can be found in this repository.

Next steps:
* Extract fonts from ROMs.
* Build ESP32 module with a web server to print labels.
