# NEC PinWriter P6+

We had this printer growing up. In recent years, I have developed an interest for retro computing.
I found two of these printers cheap on the local equivalent of Craig's List (Kleinanzeigen).

Check the [3D Print Files](3d/README.md) directory for a replacement paper support, which seems to be prone to breaking.

## Next Steps
* Extract fonts from ROMs.
** This is proving to be much harder than I had hoped.
* Build ESP32 module with a web server to print labels.
