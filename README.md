# NEC PinWriter P6+

We had this printer growing up. In recent years, I have developed an interest for retro computing.
I found two of these printers cheap on the local equivalent of Craig's List (Kleinanzeigen).

## 3D Model of Paper Support

Only one came with a paper support, and it had one of the retention arms broken off. I modelled this and 3D-printed a replacement.
The 3mf model can be found in this repository.

When printing, print "face down," i.e. with the part that the paper rests against on the print bed.

Supports are only needed for the round studs which snaps into the detents on the printer proper.

You'll need a fairly large printer to print this part (295mm wide printable width).

## Next Steps
* Extract fonts from ROMs.
* Build ESP32 module with a web server to print labels.
