# 3D Print Files

When I bought my 3D printers second hand, 30 years after they had been produced, only one came with the tilt-up paper support,
and on that one of the hinges had broken off.

I modelled a paper support in Fusion 360. It is not an identical copy of the original. Fonts and marks had been embossed on the
original model, and they are now recessed in the model, so that it can be printed with (almost) no supports. The font is bigger
to give the 3D printer a reasonable chance to render them legibly. Chamfers are chosen such that they are printable. In the
case of the bottom edge this means a steeper chamfer than the original model.

The sliders are bespoke to the model, and are not interchangable with the original ones. Only the right hand slider was modelled.
Mirror it in your slicer to obtain the left slider.

When I first printed the model, I did not have one with a bed which was large enough. The model was split, and is joined together
with jigsaw-like features. To give the model stability, cut three 3mm steel rods to a length of about 29cm. The exact length does
not matter; They should just not be too long. The rods are inserted in the three holes on the side after the two pieces are joined
together.

When I finally did get a printer which had a large enough print bed (Anycubic Kobra 3 Max), it was not nearly as good as my
Prusa MK3 in resolving the lettering. A bold font alternative was added for this.

## Slicer Settings

The paper support is printed face-down, the sliders on its "side."

In PrusaSlicer as well as AnycubicSlicerNext, I've used the 0.2mm "quality" preset. Supports were only painted on the little
nubs that make up the hinge mechanism. For this part, normal supports are prefereable over tree supports. They come off very easily.

## Filament Choice

I used "bone white" PLA for the support, which matched the yellowed color of the PinWriters pretty well. I do not intend to
retrobright them. If you do, you'll need a lighter color filament.

For the sliders I used some dar gray PLA I had lying around.

I went with PLA since the parts are not exposed to any significant heat. They have not warped in the years that I've used them.
